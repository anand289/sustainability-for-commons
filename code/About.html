				<p> &quot; If there's a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it.&quot; -<i>Toni Morrision</i></p>

					<p>Though not a book, but this blog is an attempt to quench the thirst for some straight-forward, easy and possibly interesting ways to discuss modern world&apos;s one of the most pressing topics- sustainability.</p>

					<p>As a child I always wondered, how can my simple act of switching off a fan, or using LEDs instead of normal &quot;yellow bulbs&quot; can save the planet. Growing young, I wondered how the influx of Electric Vehicles can change the energy scenario, and then the ponderings of whether sustainability really is an issue of poor&apos;s or is it the richer section of society which needs to be enlightened about this began to come in. </p>

					<p>The only thing which has been common throughout the life was the fact that I just &quot;wondered&quot;, and that is the level most of us ever manage to achieve. Though it&apos;s not a bad place to start, but a terrible one to finish at. One of the most common reasons for people to get stuck here is their lack of knowledge, or rather the lack of simple and straight-forward sources.Let&apos;s be honest, working for sustainability is not as cool as being concerned about it. Life cycle assessments and drawing out the mid-point matrix of any product or technology is as dull as accounting, if not worse!</p>

					<p>Instead of diving into the myriad of concepts and abstruse explanations, isn&apos;t it better to pick sustainability up by pieces and build our knowledge around it? That&apos;s exactly what the idea is. I have tried to break the concept into smaller units called cards mostly with an aim to answer your everyday ponderings. However, there is definitely a scope for more if you dig deep.</p>
