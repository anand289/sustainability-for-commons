" If there's a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it." -Toni MorrisionIDEA:Though not a book, but this blog is an attempt to quench the thirst for some straight-forward, easy and possibly interesting ways to discuss modern world's one of the most pressing topics- sustainability.As a child I always wondered, how can my simple act of switching off a fan, or using LEDs instead of normal "yellow bulbs" can save the planet. Growing young, I wondered how the influx of electric vehicles can change the energy scenario, and then the ponderings of whether sustainability really an issue of poor’s is or is it the richer section of society which needs to be enlightened about this began to come in.The only thing which has been common throughout the life was the fact that I just "wondered", and that is the level most of us ever manage to achieve. Though it's not a bad place to start, but a terrible one to finish at. One of the most common reasons for people to get stuck here is their lack of knowledge, or rather the lack of simple and straight-forward sources.Let's be honest, working for sustainability is not as cool as being concerned about it. Life cycle assessments and drawing out the mid-point matrix of any product or technology is as dull as accounting, if not worse!Instead of diving into the myriad of concepts and abstruse explanations, isn't it better to pick sustainability up by pieces and build our knowledge around it? That's exactly what the idea is. I have tried to break the concept into smaller units called cards mostly with an aim to answer your everyday ponderings. However, there is definitely a scope for more if you dig deep.COLLABORATION: 1. Help with articles on sustainability:There is more going on in the world of sustainability than an eye can track, and thus asking for collaboration and coming up with some interesting, eye-opening, fun and most-importantly easy to understand articles will be needed and will be highly appreciated. 2. Help with website enhancement:Also, I am not a web developer or capable of making stunning websites by any stretch of imagination, and thus will need the more creative and talented ones out there to make this website as “well-designed” as possible.
